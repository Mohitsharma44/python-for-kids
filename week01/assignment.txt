# Week 1 Assignment: Gold Collector Game

## 🎮 How to Get Started:
1. Open `gold_collector_game.py` in your code editor
2. Run the game to see how it works
3. Follow the instructions in the code to unlock new features!
4. Fill in your `mission_report.txt` as you go!

## Learning Objectives:
- Understand basic game programming concepts
- Learn about variables, functions, and control flow
- Practice keyboard input and collision detection
- Explore randomness in programming

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Challenges:

### Step 1: Understanding the Basics (Beginner)
1. Run the game and collect 5 coins. What happens?
2. Look at the code and find where the player's speed is set
3. Change the speed to 10. What happens? Try speed = 2. What happens?
4. Find the line that sets the background color. Change it to a different color!

### Step 2: Unlocking Sprites (Intermediate)
1. Find the line `USE_SPRITES = False` and change it to `USE_SPRITES = True`
2. Run the game again. What changed?
3. Look at the console output. What message do you see?
4. If you don't have the images, the game will still work with shapes!

### Step 3: Random Movement (Advanced)
1. Find the line `USE_RANDOM_MOVEMENT = False` and change it to `True`
2. Run the game and collect a coin. What's different now?
3. Look at the console output when you collect coins
4. Find the `move_coin_to_new_position()` function. What does it do?

### Step 4: Experimentation (Creative)
1. Change the player's color by modifying the RGB values
2. Change the coin's color
3. Add a new variable called `player_size` and make the player bigger or smaller
4. Try changing the window size (WIDTH and HEIGHT)

## 🤔 Thinking Questions:
1. Why do we use `max()` and `min()` functions for player movement?
2. What's the difference between `USE_SPRITES = True` and `USE_SPRITES = False`?
3. How does the game know when you've collected a coin?
4. What happens if you remove the `global score` line?

## 🎯 Bonus Challenges:
1. Add a timer that counts down from 60 seconds
2. Create multiple coins that appear at the same time
3. Add obstacles that the player should avoid
4. Make the coin move automatically every 3 seconds

## 📬 How to Submit:
1. Open `mission_report.txt` in your code editor
2. Fill in each section as you complete the steps
3. Save the file
4. Email your completed `mission_report.txt` to your instructor
   - Subject line: **"Week 01 Mission Report - [Your Name]"**
   - Attach the file, or copy-paste the contents into the email
5. OPTIONAL: Also attach your modified `gold_collector_game.py` if you
   made cool changes you want to show off!

## 💡 Tips for Success:
- Save your work before making changes!
- If something breaks, you can always copy the original code back
- Try changing one thing at a time
- Don't be afraid to experiment - that's how you learn!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting:
- **Game won't run?** Make sure you have Pygame Zero installed
- **Images not showing?** That's okay! The game works with shapes too
- **Code has errors?** Check that you didn't accidentally delete any important lines
