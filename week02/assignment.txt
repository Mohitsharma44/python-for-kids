# Week 2 Assignment: Star Dodger 🚀

## 🎮 How to Get Started:
1. Open `star_dodger.py` in your code editor
2. Run the game — dodge the falling asteroids!
3. Follow the challenges below to learn about LISTS and FOR LOOPS
4. Fill in your `mission_report.txt` as you go!

## Learning Objectives:
- Learn about **lists** — storing many objects in one variable
- Learn about **for loops** — doing the same thing to every item in a list
- Understand `append()` — adding new items to a list
- Learn about removing items from a list safely (the "to_remove" pattern)
- Use `clock.schedule_interval()` for timed events
- Understand functions that **return values** (`get_asteroid_speed()`)

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Challenges:

### Step 1: Play and Tweak (Beginner)
1. Run the game and try to survive! How long can you last?
2. Find `ASTEROID_SPEED = 3` and change it to `1`. Run again — is it easier?
3. Now try `ASTEROID_SPEED = 6`. Whoa! 🏎️
4. Find `lives = 3` and change it to `5`. More chances to survive!
5. Look at the console output — it shows messages every time the asteroids
   list changes! Watch for the 📦 and 🗑️ messages.

✅ **Checkpoint:** You've completed Step 1 when you can change the speed
   and lives, and you've seen the list messages in the console!

### Step 2: Unlock Sprites and Invincibility (Intermediate)
1. Find `USE_SPRITES = False` and change it to `True` — now you have
   a real spaceship! 🚀
2. Run the game. Look at the console — what message do you see?
3. Find `USE_INVINCIBILITY = False` and change it to `True`
4. Play the game and get hit. What happens to your ship? (Watch it blink!)
5. Find the line with `clock.schedule_unique(end_invincibility, 2.0)`.
   The `2.0` means 2 seconds. Try changing it to `5.0` or `0.5`!

✅ **Checkpoint:** You've completed Step 2 when you can see sprites
   and your ship blinks after getting hit!

### Step 3: Understand Lists — The Big New Concept! (Advanced)
This is the most important step this week! Take your time with this one.

1. Find this line near the top of the code:
   ```
   asteroids = []
   ```
   The `[]` creates an **empty list**. Think of it like an empty backpack!
   In Week 01, if you wanted multiple coins, you'd need `coin1`, `coin2`,
   `coin3`... Lists solve this — ONE variable holds ALL the asteroids!

2. Find the `spawn_asteroid()` function. Look for this line:
   ```
   asteroids.append(asteroid)
   ```
   `append()` adds a new item to the END of the list.
   It's like putting a new book in your backpack!
   Watch the console — every time this runs, you'll see:
   `📦 asteroids.append(asteroid) → list now has X item(s)`

3. Now find the for loop in `update()` that moves asteroids:
   ```
   for asteroid in asteroids:
       asteroid.y += current_speed
   ```
   This loop visits EVERY asteroid in the list and moves it down.
   Whether there are 2 or 200, this SAME code handles them all!
   Imagine writing `asteroid1.y += 3`, `asteroid2.y += 3`... for each one. 😵

4. Find the "to_remove" pattern in `update()`:
   ```
   asteroids_to_remove = []
   ```
   Read the comment above it! It explains why we can't remove items
   from a list while looping through it. Watch the console for:
   `🗑️  asteroids.remove() × 1 → list now has X item(s)`

5. Enable bonus stars: `USE_BONUS_STARS = True`
   Play the game and watch the console. Can you spot where bonus stars
   use the EXACT same pattern? (Hint: look for `bonus_stars = []`)

✅ **Checkpoint:** You've completed Step 3 when you can explain what
   `append()` does and you've seen the 📦 and 🗑️ console messages!

### Step 4: Crank Up the Difficulty! (Creative)
1. Enable `USE_INCREASING_DIFFICULTY = True`
   - Play for a while. Do you notice the asteroids getting faster?
   - A new "Speed" display appears on screen — watch it climb!
2. Find `clock.schedule_interval(spawn_asteroid, 1.5)` near the bottom
   - The `1.5` means "every 1.5 seconds". Try changing it!
   - Set it to `0.5` for asteroid rain! ☔ Or `3.0` for a chill game
3. Enable ALL features at once! Set every toggle to True and play.
   How does the game feel with everything enabled?

✅ **Checkpoint:** You've completed Step 4 when you've played with
   all features enabled and tweaked the spawn timing!

## 🤔 Thinking Questions:
Answer these in your `mission_report.txt`! There are no wrong answers —
just explain your thinking.

1. In Week 01, imagine you had `coin1`, `coin2`, `coin3`... all the way
   up to `coin50`. You'd need 50 variables and 50 collision checks!
   How do lists make this easier?

2. Why do we use `for asteroid in asteroids:` instead of writing
   `asteroid1.y += 3`, `asteroid2.y += 3`, `asteroid3.y += 3` for each?
   What if the number of asteroids keeps changing — how does the loop help?

3. What would happen if we NEVER removed asteroids from the list, even
   after they fall off the screen? (Hint: watch the "Asteroids on screen"
   counter. Imagine if that number kept going up forever... 📈)

4. We use a separate `asteroids_to_remove` list instead of removing asteroids
   while looping. Want to know why? Try this experiment:
   - Find the removal code in `update()` (search for `asteroids_to_remove`)
   - What do you think would go wrong if you removed items from a list
     while counting through it? (Imagine someone pulling cards from a deck
     while you're trying to count them!)

5. Remember when you discovered `clock.schedule_interval()` in Week 01?
   Can you explain in your own words what
   `clock.schedule_interval(spawn_asteroid, 1.5)` does?

## 🎯 Bonus Challenges:
These are extra challenges for when you finish early or want more!
Pick whichever ones sound fun — you don't have to do them all.

1. **High Score Tracker:** Create a variable `high_score = 0` at the top.
   When the game ends, update it: `high_score = max(score, high_score)`.
   Show it on the game over screen! Can you beat your own record?

2. **Random Asteroid Sizes:** Right now all asteroids are 30x30.
   Make some bigger and some smaller using `random.choice([20, 30, 40])`.
   You'll need to change the size in `spawn_asteroid()` where the Rect
   is created. Bigger = harder to dodge!

3. **Screen-Clear Power-Up:** Add a power-up that clears all asteroids!
   Here's a recipe to get you started:
   - Create a new list: `powerups = []`
   - Write a `spawn_powerup()` function (copy `spawn_bonus_star` as a base)
   - When the player touches it: `asteroids.clear()` — boom, all gone!
   - Add a timer: `clock.schedule_interval(spawn_powerup, 30.0)`

4. **Asteroid Color Party:** Make asteroids change color! In the `draw()`
   function where asteroids are drawn as circles, try using
   `random.choice([(255,100,100), (100,255,100), (100,100,255)])`
   instead of the gray color. What happens? Why do they keep changing?

5. **Two-Player Mode:** Add a second spaceship controlled with WASD keys!
   Start by copying how `player` is created, but name it `player2`.
   Add WASD movement in `update()` (use `keyboard.a`, `keyboard.d`, etc.)
   and add collision checks for `player2` too!

## 📬 How to Submit:
1. Open `mission_report.txt` in your code editor
2. Fill in each section as you complete the steps
3. Save the file
4. Email your completed `mission_report.txt` to your instructor
   - Subject line: **"Week 02 Mission Report - [Your Name]"**
   - Attach the file, or copy-paste the contents into the email
5. OPTIONAL: Also attach your modified `star_dodger.py` if you made
   cool changes you want to show off!

## 💡 Tips for Success:
- Save your work before making changes!
- If something breaks, change the settings back to False
- Try changing ONE thing at a time — it's easier to see what changed
- Watch the console output — it shows what's happening inside the lists!
- The "Asteroids on screen" counter shows the list growing and shrinking
- Don't be afraid to experiment — that's how real programmers learn! 🧪

## 🔧 Troubleshooting:
- **Game won't run?** Make sure you have Pygame Zero installed
- **Images not showing?** That's okay! The game works with shapes too
  (keep USE_SPRITES = False)
- **Too hard?** Lower ASTEROID_SPEED to 1 or increase lives to 10
- **Too easy?** Raise ASTEROID_SPEED to 6 or set lives to 1
- **Asteroids not spawning?** Make sure you didn't accidentally delete
  the `clock.schedule_interval` line at the bottom of the file
- **Game freezes after game over?** Press SPACE to restart!
- **Code has errors?** Check that you didn't accidentally delete any
  important lines. You can always copy the original code back!
